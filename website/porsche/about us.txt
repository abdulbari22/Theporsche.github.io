Origin
Ferdinand Porsche founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH"[4] with Adolf Rosenberger[5] and Anton Piëch in 1931.[6] The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart.[7] Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting,[4] but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people; that is, a Volkswagen.[4] This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time.[8] The Porsche 64 was developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.[4]


Porsche's tank prototype, the "Porsche Tiger", that lost to Henschel & Son's Tiger I.

Panzerjäger Elefant – after the loss of the contract to the Tiger I, Porsche recycled his design into a tank destroyer.
During World War II,[9] Volkswagen production turned to the military version of the Volkswagen Beetle, the Kübelwagen,[9] 52,000 produced, and Schwimmwagen,[9] 15,584 produced.[10] Porsche produced several designs for heavy tanks during the war, losing out to Henschel & Son in both contracts that ultimately led to the Tiger I and the Tiger II. However, not all this work was wasted, as the chassis Porsche designed for the Tiger I was used as the base for the Elefant tank destroyer. Porsche also developed the Maus super-heavy tank in the closing stages of the war, producing two prototypes.[11] Ferdinand Porsche's biographer, Fabian Müller, wrote that Porsche had thousands of people forcibly brought to work at their factories during the war. The workers wore the letter "P" on their clothing at all times. It stood not for "Porsche," but for "Poland."[12]
Developments

1952 Porsche 356 K/9-1 Prototype
In post-war Germany, parts were generally in short supply, so the 356 automobile used components from the Volkswagen Beetle, including the engine case from its internal combustion engine, transmission, and several parts used in the suspension. The 356, however, had several evolutionary stages, A, B, and C, while in production, and most Volkswagen-sourced parts were replaced by Porsche-made parts. Beginning in 1954 the 356s engines started utilizing engine cases designed specifically for the 356. The sleek bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, who also had designed the body of the Beetle. Porsche's signature designs have, from the beginning, featured air-cooled rear-engine configurations (like the Beetle), rare for other car manufacturers, but producing automobiles that are very well balanced.
